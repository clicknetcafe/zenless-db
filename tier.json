		"desc": "*2.2 Prydwen Tier List (04/09/2025)*\n\nHere's the changelog for today's update:\n\n- *Seed* added as T1 Primary DPS + placed on watchlist. Seed is currently incomplete and lacking a dedicated partner. We expect Orphie, the other character revealed alongside Seed to be exactly this partner, after which she’ll almost certainly find her way into T0.5 or higher. With current support we’ve found her performance closer to agents like Jane and S0 Anby. Seed sheds some light on outdated units like Nekomata and Billy but until Orphie will have to sit tight before gaining her place in the top tiers.\n- *Nekomata* T4 —> T3 + Partner (Seed) Tag added. Seed and Nekomata work together surprisingly well thanks to Nekomata’s effective Energy funneling for Seed. Hence, Nekomata finally gets out of the bottom tier albeit with the partner tag.\n- *Burnice* T0.5 —> T1. While Burnice is the “weakest” limited Secondary DPS she has remarkable performance in several teams even to this day. The only reason why she was bumped out of the Apex power bracket is because she has been outclassed in all teams by Vivian, and in teams where Yanagi is great as a Secondary (like Alice and Miyabi) she also displays significantly higher performance, so we dropped Burnice down to T1 to reflect this.\n- *Lycaon* T0.5 —> T1. Lycaon is in a similar position to Burnice where he was bumped down not due to lack of his own strength but rather because he got outclassed in his best use case (Miyabi Mono Ice teams) by Yuzuha. While Lycaon is still one of the 2 best Stunners for Hugo as well as Ellen, his best use case has become less relevant with the release of Yuzuha which warrants this tier drop.\n- *Trigger* T0.5 —> T1. Trigger could still be argued to have T0.5 level performance provided she has her Signature W-Engine thanks to the remarkable potential it nets her as a general buffer, stunner and DEF Shred applier. However, since our Tier List doesn’t include Signatures currently she’s moving down to T1.\n- *Lucy* T1 —> T1.5. While Lucy still has great flexibility in almost any team in the game, her buffs have gotten outclassed by all of the best teams of the characters in the tiers above her (and she’s outclassed everywhere by Yuzuha, Nicole and Astra too barring very few exceptions). Lucy isn’t performing as well as she used to due, hence we dropped her down a tier.\n- *Caesar* T1 —> T1.5. Similarly to Lucy, while Caesar’s shields and ability to provide Interruption Resistance are definitely great, her main issue is that her ATK buff only applies to a single Agent at once. Unfortunately for her, we’ve entered a meta where either multiple Agents contribute to a single damage total (being any Anomaly team), or multiple Agents want to deal damage at once. While Caesar’s buffing potential might not be quite where it once was and while we do acknowledge her shielding is a game changer in the eyes of many who enjoy the comfort they provide, we're still moving forward with moving her down."

		"desc": "*2.1-2 Prydwen Tier List (05/08/2025)*\n\nIn this update we’re merging the Stun and Support categories into one category. The reason behind this is that both character types often filled the same supportive team slots in compositions interchangeably (albeit with slightly different flavors). With this change stunners and “old supports” will now be ranked against each other which we feel is closer to how players build teams in game.\n\nWith that said, to highlight the difference in style between “old supports” and stun units we are adding a new [Stun] tag to the old stun category units. This includes: Lighter, Lycaon, Trigger, Ju Fufu, Qingyi, Pulchra, Koleda and Anby. Stun Tag description: Agent belongs in the Stun category in-game, characterized by their shared ability to apply much more Daze than other Agents, generally focusing on Stun-related Disk Drives and stats.\n\nWe’re also cleaning up some tags that no longer make sense or aren’t needed in the current state of the game.\n- Removed the following tags: Buff, Disorder, Hybrid (Stun)\n\nIn addition to this we’re also further clarifying which characters the partner tag refers to. This can be seen on:\n- On Soldier 11: Partner (Lighter)\n- On Ju Fufu: Partner (Yixuan)\n- On Soukaku: Partner (Miyabi)\n- On Anton: Partner (Astra Yao)\n*Note* that Partner tags go one way, but not the other (Miyabi is not partner tagged with Soukaku, however Soukaku is partner tagged with Miyabi, due to needing her to reach her level of performance but not the other way around).\n\nNow into the actual Tier List placement changes:\n- We’re placing *Alice* in T0.5 Primary DPS as based on testing she performs a little better in the Physical Anomaly DPS department than Jane and Piper. With that said it’s worth noting upcoming endgame encounters are expected to favor her and characters with similar damage profiles heavily (Jane & Piper), meaning after this period it’s possible her rating will need to be re-evaluated. Also we want to highlight the difference between Alice with her signature and without is more pronounced than on other Agents.\n- *Jane Doe* T1.5 —> T1. Speaking of the devil, with Alice’s release on top of the momentum from Yuzuha and the shift toward Physical anomaly in endgame, we find it time for Jane to rise once again back to T1.\n- *Piper* T1.5 —> T1. Piper shares many similarities with Jane and has/is benefitting from many of the same boosts. Piper doesn’t have the Anomaly CRIT that Jane has, nor as much flexibility but we feel she is close enough in performance to Jane to raise her to T1 alongside her for now.\n- *Koleda* T2 —> T3. We moved Koleda to the Niche character bracket since Koleda provides little buff in spite of her big ability to apply Daze. With more and more Stun Agent alternatives releasing recently such as Trigger, Ju Fufu and Pulchra as well as Lighter always being a stronger option in all the best teams Koleda is a part of, she finds herself easily replaced and belonging in the Niche character bracket much more than before.\n- *Anby (A-rank)* T3 —> T4. Very similarly to Koleda, with way more Stun Agent options releasing over time, Anby has found herself at the bottom of the Stun category due to her lack of buffs, significantly behind other Agents — now the same goes for the Support category. Her inability to enhance other Agents’ damage on top of applying Daze, which is something all other Stun Agents are capable of, unfortunately lead her to be at the bottom of the Tier List as she is always outclassed by options above her.\b- *Ben* moved to DPS. Ben has some of the lowest play rates among all Agents in endgame, but when he is played, right now it’s as a DPS, not a support. Based on this we’re moving him over to the DPS category for now instead of support.\n- *Soukaku* Partner (Miyabi) Tag added. Soukaku’s place on the tier list is based off of her synergy with Miyabi and when played without her alongside other damage dealers her ranking falls significantly. Hugo would prefer to play with Daze based supports and Ellen isn’t powerful enough of a synergy to keep soukaku’s ranking in Apex. Based on this we’re giving Soukaku the partner tag to show her ranking is based on her being played with Miyabi.\n- *Lucy, Caesar and Rina* added to the Watchlist. All three of these Support Agents are outliers on our current Tier List as they’re underperforming compared to their tier peers. We’re watch listing these characters for now to see how they perform in the upcoming phase before making adjustments to their placement."

		"desc": "*2.1 Prydwen Tier List (16/07/2025)*\n\nWe’ll be forward and say this Tier List update won’t shake up the meta too much — Yuzuha’s arrival has changed a lot to the max potential of a number of Anomaly teams, and spoiler alert, she’s definitely cementing herself as a top meta Support. However, we deemed her impact on the teams she’s best in does not change most characters’ positions on the Tier List. Nonetheless, we welcome all feedback and will take your feedback into account for our next Tier List update!\n\n- *Yuzuha* added as T0 Support. Yuzuha is one of the best Agents to have released at this point in time. Best in slot for basically every Anomaly Agent but Miyabi - and even that one’s debatable - on top of being very close to Astra Yao in any and every team possible, if not outright better than her in niche non-Anomaly teams, or even working alongside Astra in Double Support teams if she wants to, Yuzuha does it all. All of this without her W-Engine required, Yuzuha shines just as bright as Astra, cementing her position at the top.\n- *Caesar* T0.5 —> T1. This was warranted since we watchlisted her last update, but while Caesar retains amazing ease of use thanks to her ability to provide Interruption Resistance to the active party member, her buffs in terms of damage - while still good - have undeniably been falling behind those above her, particularly with Yuzuha’s release. Caesar remains more than usable, particularly for those of you who don’t want to overthink things when clearing endgame content. Nonetheless, her lack in damage buffs compared to the Agents above her warranted her drop."

	"2.0-2": {
		"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clicknetcafe/zenless-db/refs/heads/main/tier/tier_2.0-2.jpg",
		"desc": "*2.0-2 Prydwen Tier List (25/06/2025)*\n\nAlong with Ju Fufu’s release, we did some further testing with Yixuan to finalize her placement along with a good chunk of other Stun and Support Agents. The changes are as follows:\n\n- *Ju Fufu* —> Added as T0.5 Stun with the Partner tag. Ju Fufu finds a niche specifically in Yixuan, who she buffs way better than anyone else via off-field Aftershock damage and Daze, but most importantly buffs to all of her top stats: CRIT, Ultimate, and Chain Attack DMG. All of this without any limited W-Engines needed. Ju Fufu’s ability to give extra Ultimates over time via her Decibel increase and Decibel refund mechanics are also very strong in particular with Yixuan. While Ju Fufu has flexibility outside of these teams, compared to Lighter and Lycaon who perform the best of any Agent with some of the best DPS in the game, as well as Trigger who has more universally strong buffs, Ju Fufu would find herself somewhere in between T1 and T1.5 depending on her teammates outside of Yixuan teams (mostly having a good synergy with S0 Anby but even there Trigger holds more value). For this reason we decided to go with a ranking that reflects her top performance with one of the best DPS in the game (being Yixuan), while giving her the Partner tag to reflect her tendency to be outclassed outside of these teams.\n- *Yixuan* T0.5 —> T0 and Expert and Watchlist removed. Yixuan was already the second best DPS in the game on her release, now with Ju Fufu in the mix she approaches Miyabi closer than ever. Mostly depending on the enemy and player skill (which impacts what team Miyabi is best used in), they go back and forth in terms of power level, which makes Yixuan our second ever DPS to enter T0 since the Void Hunter’s release.\n- *Trigger* T0 —> T0.5. Trigger’s position in the meta is too dependent on her Signature W-Engine, which our Tier List doesn’t factor in. She has great team flexibility, but the DEF Shred her Signature W-Engine makes her provide is a good chunk of the reason why she’s so efficient. Without her Signature, she’s not worth considering in nearly as many teams and S0 Anby is her best bet, but she’s only in T1. Additionally, with Ju Fufu’s release, she lost one of her top use cases in the form of Yixuan teams where she’s now outclassed. Lighter, who stood in the same tier as her up until now, has no reliance on his Signature W-Engine to perform (even though it’s a small boost to his performance), and he has retained top tier synergies with some of the strongest DPS such as Evelyn and Hugo making him way more desired. For these reasons, we deem Trigger is best fit alongside Ju Fufu and Lycaon, but she is comfortably in that spot and gains a lot of value with her Signature in mind.\n- *Anton* - partner tag added. Anton needs Astra Yao to play at his best, as his optimal playstyle is doing damage solely via Quick Assists, which keeps him permanently in Burst Mode thanks to his M1 effect provided you don’t do any other attacks with him (which is pretty easy to keep in mind). Anton is undeniably a bottom tier character without Astra Yao, but he can dish out some surprisingly good performances alongside her so we are adding the Partner tag to him for this reason.\n- *Caesar* - watchlist added. She retains amazing comfort of play thanks to her big Shield and ability to provide Interruption Resistance, but she contributes less to the party’s damage than other buffers in the current meta, so we're watchlisting her with the potential to move to T1 next update. Her main issue is that her Shield only buffs the active Agent. This is severely impactful as lots of Agents operate from off-field and she cannot give the ATK buff to them. By extension, can’t apply the ATK buff to any Swap Cancelled abilities. This severely impacts her value in the meta as a damage buffer, not to mention recent Stun Agents also started providing strong party-wide buffs as well while simply inflicting higher Daze than Caesar."

		"desc": "*2.0 Prydwen Tier List (06/06/2025)*\n\nZZZ 2.0 has brought a lot of changes to the meta, to say the least. A brand new class of Agents was introduced and new characters, W-Engines and Disc Drives along with it, giving build options and team compositions significantly more variety. As a result of this, on top of older Agents getting directly buffed such as Ellen, the meta has been shaken up quite a bit, a fact which you’ll notice has caused a lot of changes to the Tier List. This is in fact our longest Changelog yet since we went for close to a full overhaul, but we deemed it necessary that along with Zenless Zone Zero season 2, we make a Prydwen Tier List season 2 as well. We’ll go into complete detail, so we recommend you have a look at how the Tier List evolved and if you notice any changes that need further explanation, you check what we individually wrote for them in this Changelog.\n\nLet’s tackle the new category we’re adding first: Secondary DPS. Details on what is factored into their ratings will be found in the Criteria & Roles section above this Changelog. Here’s the description for the role:\n- Secondary DPS Agents cover a particular section of Attack & Anomaly Agents who play a role as the secondary damage dealer in the team. They deal damage in short windows of time and leave the field quickly, often doing damage even while off-field to let the on-field DPS Agent shine. In any case, these Agents can be summed up to characters with the ability to provide supportive firepower for their teams, whether that is to act purely as a secondary source of damage, or to buff the on-field DPS Agent and apply Anomaly all the while if desirable.\n- To go along with this, the DPS category has been renamed to Primary DPS (this is simply for clarification purposes).\n\nThis change was done in light of indicating the ability of certain Agents like Yanagi to act as both the Primary and Secondary DPS of the team depending on the composition, as well as painting the full picture of Zenless Zone Zero teambuilding and playstyles in a clearer manner.\n\nThe characters who are transitioning from Primary DPS to Secondary DPS are as follows:\n- *Vivian* —> Added as T0 (to explain briefly, Vivian is the best at her role and provides a big increase in power over Burnice to a lot of teams like Jane and Piper, hence why we separated the two and let Vivian sit at the top. Remember characters in different categories are rated within their own category, not with characters in other categories).\n- *Burnice* —> Added as T0.5.\n- *Yanagi* —> Added as T0.5.\n- *Grace* —> Added as T3.\n\nCertain characters are also staying in the Primary DPS category while being present in the SubDPS category (we detail this in the next part).\nHere is how the DPS rankings evolved:\n- *Yixuan* —> Added as T0.5 Expert Main DPS (also placed on Watchlist).\nWe’ve decided to tread carefully about how we handle placing Main DPS characters on the same tier as Miyabi. We’ll make something clear: Yixuan is the closest character to Miyabi’s power level that we’ve seen yet. She has good baseline performance but much like Miyabi, really high room for optimization via quickswaps during her stun windows. Without question, when fully optimized Yixuan goes up to Miyabi’s level of performance (which is why she has the Expert tag). We decided to watchlist Yixuan to potentially go into T0 instead of directly placing her there because on paper, against a hypothetical enemy that favours neither Yixuan nor Miyabi, Miyabi should still perform ahead of Yixuan.\nWhile this isn’t applicable to all scenarios, if you couldn’t tell by how long this paragraph already is, it’s difficult to compare the two in a 100% accurate manner. Overall, we hope Ju Fufu’s release, being the latest Stun character, will improve Yixuan’s performance and clarify whether Yixuan should go into T0 or not.\n- *Ellen* T2 —> T1. Ellen is the first character whose kit has been directly modified by Hoyoverse. It makes her much, much more powerful than before, as it’s much more cohesive and has significantly improved her damage by giving her some fancy new attacks with high multipliers. In short, her new kit is amazing news for her, so we recommend you try her out and let us know what you think!\n- *S0 Anby* T0.5 —> T1. Now that endgame content stopped favouring Aftershock Agents so much, it’s become easier to realize S0 Anby was not matching in performance to her peers in T0.5. Note that she still remains really strong and in fact is one of the top DPS Agents in the game — being in T1 still means she is really good. A simple look at who’s in T0.5 and who’s in T1 should picture why we did this change in a much clearer light. Note she hasn’t become any worse than she was before though.\n- *Piper* T1 —> T1.5. Since we last left her in T1, Piper is an Agent who didn’t get any major upgrades while her peers did. While she still displays performance worthy of being placed next to Harumasa (at a baseline casual level), Jane got a huge upgrade in the form of Vivian, and Zhu Yuan has always been one of the top-performing DPS Agents. While Piper remains very much usable in 2.0’s day and age she isn’t to the level of T1 characters, which warrants her dropping down.\n- *Jane* T1 —> T1.5. Piper and Jane share very similar results with each other; overall, they’re pretty comparable characters in strength. It will be no surprise to those who have extensively tested both that Piper and Jane are dropping down to T1.5 together. Having said this, they have both gotten a buff in the form of Vivian as their new best teammate so they aren’t unviable at all, hence why they’re now in the same tier as Harumasa.\n- *Corin* T4 —> T3. We’ve taken interest in the low tiers this update, they had been on our list of Agents to watch out for since a few updates ago. Corin is one of the characters who benefitted from Astra Yao the most — she now has a really potent double Support core with Nicole who can buff her DPS to crazy margins, especially via Corin’s really high-value Quick Assist. We’re considering adding a Quick Assist-focused playstyle to Corin’s calculations as a result, so be on the lookout for that in the future. Overall, this new playstyle allows her to rise back up to T3.\n- *Anton* T4 —> T3. Very similarly to Corin, Anton is a Quick Assist DPS bumped up to the extreme — in fact, he has the highest Quick Assist multiplier in the game, going as high as some Agents’ EX Specials. He’s especially more reliant on the high amount of Quick Assists Astra provides him than Corin, who can still function with teammates like Caesar, so we are considering giving him the Partner tag in the future; we’ll test him out further and conclude on that in the next update or two.\n- *Nekomata* T3 —> T4. Nowadays, Nekomata pales in comparison to Agents like Corin and Anton who have acquired their newfound Quick Assist playstyles to enhance their damage and remain viable. It’s become really difficult to get good performance out of Nekomata and this reflects in our clear data for both Shiyu Defense and Deadly Assault. Overall, this warrants a drop down to T4.\n\nLet’s tackle the Stun position changes:\n- *Qingyi* T0.5 —> T1. With more and more meta DPS Agents preferring an on-field playstyle (Ellen, Miyabi, Yixuan, S0 Anby among others) and Stun agents that take less of the spotlight (such as Lighter & Trigger) to accomodate for the DPS’s field time requirements, Qingyi has progressively seen less and less use. She sees some use cases with Agents like Evelyn and Hugo, but is never the best option there and is nowadays is mostly used with Agents like Harumasa and Zhu Yuan instead. Due to their position in the meta not being as high, we deemed bringing Qingyi down to T1 as the fairest decision we could make.\n- *Pulchra* T1 —> T1.5. With S0 Anby’s drop to T1 came Pulchra’s own drop to T1.5. Pulchra especially at M6 is not a bad Stun Agent by any accounts; she’s not moving out of T1.5 any time soon. The issue however is that she’s never the best option for any Agent and only serves as a good replacement. Pulchra, at M6 especially, IS a very good replacement for any on-field DPS who needs a Stun Agent (even Hugo if you need a second Stun and don’t have any limited ones), but beyond replacement territory she is unfortunately unused, as she is overshadowed by limited S-rank Agents. For this reason along with S0 Anby (her main partner) going down, we deemed dropping her to T1.5 justifiable.\n- *Koleda* T1.5 —> T2. Koleda is becoming more and more niche the more Stun Agents come out, and with Ju Fufu on the way a drop would be even more warranted than right now. Currently, while Koleda still sees use with Evelyn, it’s a significant decrease over Lighter and that’s where she is only realistically used, otherwise she is simply a worse replacement for many DPS Agents. These factors on top of Pulchra going down and being much better than her warranted her drop.\n- *Anby* T2 —> T3. While Anby is still good at what she does, she doesn’t do anything more than applying Daze. No buffs to your DPS Agents, while everyone else above her provides that to some degree. Moving her down to the Niche power bracket is the most reasonable place we could slot her in, since that’s what she is: a niche replacement if you don’t have anyone else (in some cases she can be used over Koleda, like with Harumasa for example, but even then that’s extremely rare).\n\nNow onto Supports:\n- *Pan Yinhu* —> Added as T1 Support with the Partner tag. Pan Yinhu is an Agent who has a very unique role, which is buffing Rupture damage dealers by boosting flat Sheer Force instead of boosting general ATK like most Supports do. While ATK is still usable on Rupture Agents, his direct Sheer Force boost leads to a much higher buffing potential which Yixuan greatly appreciates. However, he currently only works with Yixuan. While usually, in light of the Partner tag this wouldn’t impact his ranking, we do consider team flexibility for Supports still — this isn’t the case for DPS Agents. Hence, as Pan Yinhu only supports one Agent effectively in the form of Yixuan, we decided to place him in T1 with the Partner tag. Note this may change as a result of more Rupture DPS Agents releasing for him to buff.\n- *Soukaku* T1 —> T0.5. It wouldn’t be unfair to call Soukaku an underrated character to this day. It is reflected in our data that Soukaku, along with Lycaon’s performance, is one of the highest in the game. While this is mostly true thanks to Miyabi, this shouldn’t be ignored; as a matter of fact, at the highest possible level, Miyabi mono ice with Soukaku and Lycaon is one of the best possible Miyabi teams. We think this holds enough merit to be placed in the highest power bracket — if an Agent functions at one of the highest levels with the best DPS in the game, this holds a lot of merit (it’s in fact the most important factor in our criteria for Supports).\n- *Lucy* T0.5 —> T1. Lucy is pretty much ZZZ’s jack of all trades, master of none (aside from very specific synergies with the Sons of Calydon in certain teams). Lucy’s buff is great while not being the strongest, it’s easy to keep full uptime on, and it works everywhere. It’s easy to say Lucy has a lot of value for anyone, and team flexibility is a big factor which kept her in T0.5 until now. However, more and more specialized Support Agents keep releasing and pushing her value within the best teams down, not to mention Nicole is free and is a straight upgrade over her in just about every team where both are viable. While Lucy is still very strong (which is why you find her on the same tier as Pan Yinhu), we dropped her down to reflect this evolution.\n- *Rina* T1 —> T1.5 + Anomaly Tag added. Rina is mainly being pushed down because Lucy and Pan Yinhu with Yixuan are much stronger than her. However, another reason is that Rina struggles to find a position over all the Support Agents higher than her on the Tier List, since she is rarely favourable as she acts as a Shock buffer which only really sees any use with Yanagi. That being said, this ability does grant her the Anomaly tag. Her PEN Ratio buff is also really nice but it is antisynergistic with Nicole who reduces enemy DEF and there are simply stronger buffs available, hence why she is moving down.\n- *Seth* T2 —> T3 + Anomaly tag added. Seth is moving to the niche power bracket because there are simply stronger options available compared to him in all possible teams. While he serves as a good replacement with Anomaly characters like Jane (who is in T1.5 for reference), he is never the best in slot and struggles to find his place on fully built accounts, so we are dropping him down to the list of niche characters for this reason. (We also added the Anomaly tag due to his ability to reduce Anomaly Buildup RES of enemies and increase Anomaly Proficiency of teammates, giving him a synergy with Anomaly characters).\n\nAnd finally, the tag changes — we went for a revamp on our tags as well, with our primary goal being to summarize all the main features of each character on the tier list in as few keywords as possible.\n\nOne of our most important goals was to indicate which category of DPS each DPS Agent belongs to, and what Supports would synergize with their archetype. To do this, we’ve proceeded as follows:\n- We’re replacing the following tags: Shatter, Burn, Shock, Corruption, Assault and regrouping all of them under the Anomaly umbrella. We’re keeping the Disorder tag as Disorder is a separate kind of Anomaly playstyle. This is because Anomalies are tied to specific elements anyway, there is no way for an Ether character to trigger Burn for example, so the information is redundant. Speaking of the Disorder tag, we took the opportunity to add it to Jane and Piper since they’re best played in Disorder teams as Assault Disorders are very strong so it reflects their playstyle.\n- Anomaly Tag description: The character’s kit is focused on dealing damage through, relies on or buffs various Attribute Anomalies.\n- The Sheer tag has been added with the following description: Characters with this archetype tag possess an element of Sheer damage in their kit and/or synergize with characters that do. Characters with this tag are generally effective when played together.\n- Other Agents are of the Attack type or simply don’t particularly synergize with Anomaly agents (supports like Lucy for example aren’t Anomaly-oriented) so we aren’t adding a tag for them since they’re the more “classic” kind of build.\n- The Buff and Debuff tag have been merged into the Buff tag umbrella: We originally separated the two because making the distinction between buffs and debuffs rarely affects certain mechanics, one such example being Trigger’s Additional Ability not being affected by M6 Nicole but being affected by 4-piece Shadow Harmony. However, these interactions are so technical and specific that we chose to declutter the tags present on our Tier List in favour of readability.\n- The Minion tag has been removed: The mechanic didn’t serve as much of a purpose and isn’t nearly as present as we assumed it would be back in 1.0. Judging as the tag serves little purpose in summarizing character kits, we decided to scrap it entirely.\n- We additionally removed the Charge and Combo tags since in the case of the Charge tag, we deem the information it provides to not be relevant enough to justify a tag for it. In the case of the Combo tag, it’s simply redundant since all Agents have to use specific combos to deal their optimal damage anyway.\n- We also removed the Hybrid (Support) tag since all of the best Stun characters operate on this dynamic of being able to both stun enemies and buff the party. Hybrid (Stun) is currently staying since it is part of Caesar’s value, but the tag is specific to her so we’ll see if we make any adjustments to it in the future.\n- And lastly, we removed the SubDPS tag (for fairly obvious reasons)."

We’re open to any feedback on our Discord server if you’re interested in voicing your opinion for potential changes.\n\n- *[Hugo]* added to the tier list (T0.5 DPS). His performance seems like he lives up to other characters in this tier, however Hugo himself hasn’t shaken the meta up too much. With that being said, he has given more team flexibility to a certain Stun Agent than before, being:\n- *[Lycaon]* T1 > T0.5. Lycaon has always had amazing performance as an F2P option for Miyabi, sometimes even outperforming premium team options in the right hands. This is clearly reflected in his performance data, and Hugo gives him even more team flexibility (he suffered from only having Ellen as an option beyond Miyabi teams). With his newfound team options with Hugo, he warrants his rise back to T0.5!"

		"desc": "*1.7 Prydwen Tier List (23/04/2025)*\n\nThe updates to the Tier List in Patch 1.7 (and possibly 2.0) will have a big focus on improving the Tier List's design & criteria to make sure every character is assessed as properly as possible. With Vivian's release, we are introducing a new tag in the form of the Partner tag (that we took from HSR) and we may also review the rest of the tags in place later on with the goal of portraying the essential points of a character's kit with a few keywords in mind. Stay tuned for more updates as usual!\n\nThe biggest change aside from the introduction of the Partner tag is that our Tier List is going from being solely based on Shiyu Defense to Shiyu Defense and Deadly Assault combined. This change will lead to the placement of certain characters fluctuating as we reevaluated how our characters are assessed.\n\nWith that being said, as the metas for both gamemodes remain very similar, we deemed combining the two modes makes the most sense instead of doing separate tier lists for both. This way, our Tier List serves as a means to assess how good a character's endgame performance is for an account as a whole.\n\n- About the Tier List and Criteria and Roles sections have been revised & updated to include both Deadly Assault and Shiyu Defense.\n- Partner tag was added to the Tags list as follows: Characters with this tag are assessed within their best team as normal, but have a necessity to include a specific limited S-rank Agent in that team that makes them perform much better than any other options. Without this specific teammate, the character may see a significant drop in performance, lowering their Tier List ranking by one or multiple tiers.\n\n*Now let's get into the actual Tier List changes:*\n- *[Vivian]* added to the tier list (T0.5 DPS),\n- *[Soldier 0 - Anby]* watchlist removed. After further testing and compilation of data, we've concluded S0 Anby's performance, even with Trigger on the team, does not get her to approach Miyabi's power level, therefore she wont be moving for now.\n- *[Caesar]* T0 -> T0.5. Caesar's placement has been in flux for multiple phases now with many questioning her place at the top of the meta (us included), so this patch we're making a change. Caesar's scores unfortunately do not get to Astra Yao's level and the discrepancy is enough where dropping her to T0.5 is unfortunately warranted. However, note that she remains the most comfortable Support character to use in any teams thanks to her huge sustain abilities and interruption resistance, even over Astra Yao.\n- *[Ellen]* T1.5 -> T2. Ellen's performance in recent Shiyu Defense and especially Deadly Assault cycles have lowered compared to a few months ago. Over time this has accumulated to where her average performance is closer to that of Soldier 11's than Harumasa. For this reason, she is unfortunately joining her in that tier, but know that neither are unviable and can perform well as they are still in the Meta Characters bracket.\n- *[Soldier 11]* Partner tag added. We deemed Soldier 11 to be the first proper character to deserve the Partner Tag in relation to Lighter, who gives her quick access to extended Stun windows and huge damage boosts which improve her performance significantly. Without Lighter, Soldier 11 can be considered as joining the Niche Character bracket in T3, but note that with his aid she will perform very well."

		"desc": "*1.6-2 Prydwen Tier List (02/04/2025)*\n\nZZZ's meta has been shifting quite a bit in recent times, and with Trigger's release Stun units are finally getting a shake up as well. Outside of a few exceptions, most DPS and Support Agents tier list placements aren’t moving as a result of Triggers release.\n\nIn addition to Trigger’s addition and the adjustment of the Stun category we’re adding a new unit tags and revising some old ones. The new addition is:\n*Heal:* Character can restore HP to themselves and/or the team, contributing to sustaining your party, particularly over longer and more difficult fights.\nThe updated tags are:\n*Debuff:* Character can inflict debuffs to enemies, causing a variety of effects that can benefit your party. Debuffs that only benefit the applier of the debuff and not the full squad are not considered.\n*Expert:* Character can be considered one placement higher than their default tier list ranking, but has an optimal playstyle that needs to be mastered to qualify for that higher rating. This tag is only applied to characters where the harder play style creates a significant discrepancy in performance compared to the baseline playstyle.\n*Quickswap:* Character’s kit benefits from swapping in and out of the field during their or other character’s rotations to maximize their potential and/or potentially mitigate long animations. Characters with this tag may feel clunkier and/or perform worse without doing so.\n\nAnd here are the changes to the tier list:\n- *[Trigger]* added as T0 Stun. Trigger is one of the most impressive Stun Agents the game has yet seen - possibly the most impressive. She has universal Support potential via a 35% Stun DMG Multiplier increase that has permanent uptime and operates off-field which gives freedom to a bunch of DPS characters she can pair with, not to mention her ease of use — possibly the easiest Stun Agent we've had yet. Even without big vertical upgrades involved, Trigger is undoubtedly T0 because her kit gives her a lot of team versatility, Daze and buffing potential, possibly the most of any Stun Agent which is impressive.\n- *[Anby: Soldier 0]* added to Watchlist. SAnby gains more than most through the inclusion of Trigger in her teams, giving her enough of a boost we’re now considering her for T0. With that said Miyabi continues to put up one of the most dominating performances of any character in a Gacha game, for this reason we’re watchlisting her first and will see how she performs moving forward before raising her.\n- *[Harumasa]* T2 > T1.5. Based on most recent performances and how players are playing him, Harumasa's baseline rating is too low compared to units he shares a tier with and who are directly above him after the recent DPS category adjustment. We’re raising his baseline rating to T1.5 and as a result his new expert rating will be T1 putting him on equal footing with Zhu Yuan and Jane doe in the hands of experienced players.\n- *[Qingyi]* T0 > T0.5. Qingyi is our first character to get out of T0 in a very long time, however enough time has passed, and enough DPS characters that don't synergize particularly well with her as well as stronger Stun Agent options have taken the spot she usually takes. Don't get us wrong, it's not because Qingyi isn't in T0 that she's by any accounts a bad Agent — she retains big team flexibility and performs notably well in S0 Anby teams more recently, plus she's still the most desirable with Harumasa and Zhu Yuan over any other Stun options. She's comfortably in T0.5, no questions asked. However, Qingyi doesn't synergize with any of the top DPS Agents anymore other than S0 Anby somewhat (and S0 Anby has Trigger and Pulchra to outperform Qingyi in most cases anyway). Miyabi, Evelyn, Yanagi and Burnice don't make particularly good use of her and that's all our T0-T0.5 DPS agents other than S0 Anby who we already discussed, so we believe Qingyi moving down to T0.5 is warranted. However with her dropping down, a lot of Stun Agents will drop down a tier as well to illustrate how much more powerful Qingyi is than them. This starts with:\n- *[Lycaon]* T0.5 > T1. Not much to say here that wasn't already said in Qingyi's entry, however we'll add part of this change is warranted because Lycaon only really serves as the best F2P option to Miyabi and Ellen which doesn't make him particularly flexible, due to Miyabi's insane variety of team options and Ellen being nowadays quite a few tiers down the top contenders. This justifies him moving to T1 further, however he's still a very good Agent to own and build no matter what, and with future Ice agents that want a Stun character on the team you can rest assured Lycaon will always be a good choice for them.\n- *[Koleda]* T1 > T1.5. Koleda has one main saving grace and that is that she's the best F2P Stun choice for Evelyn, as she increases her Chain Attack damage so she should be stable in T1.5 because Evelyn is an amazing DPS Agent, however she dropped down due to Lycaon's presence in T1 being much more felt in the current meta than Koleda.\n- *[Anby]* T1.5 > T2. Let's make something very clear: Anby's performance, for a free A-rank Stun Agent you get at the start of the game that doesn't have any special qualities, is actually impressive. Even though her kit is pure damage and Daze and nothing else, she's really good at those two things when paired with characters with downtimes such as Zhu Yuan and Harumasa, so she doesn't warrant anything below T2. However, she's overall weaker than the choices above her as they all provide something special to the team and Anby does not.\n- *[Pulchra]* is receiving no changes in placement. We did consider her dropping down along with Koleda, however at M6 she has a very desirable all-type 30% DMG debuff which boosts the whole team's damage by a good amount on top of her off-field damage and Daze, which gives her good synergies (especially with S0 Anby). This warrants her staying in T1.\n\nNow let's tackle the Tag Changes:\n- [Anby: Soldier 0] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to her Additional Ability effect (her Core Passive isn't a team-applicable debuff so it doesn't warrant the tag).\n- [Piper] Buff tag added. Pertaining to her Additional Ability effect.\n- [Grace] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to her Additional Ability effect.\n- [Corin] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to her M2.\n- [Anton] Shield, Buff tags added. Pertaining to his M2 and M4.\n- [Lighter] Buff tag added. Pertaining to his Additional Ability effect.\n- [Pulchra] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to her M6.\n- [Koleda] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to her Additional Ability effect.\n- [Astra Yao] Heal tag added. Pertaining to her Ultimate. We judged it an essential part of her kit to where the tag is worth making just for her, as well as any future characters if they do provide healing as well.\n- [Nicole] Buff, Quickswap tags added. Pertaining to her Additional Ability effect, her M6 and her playstyle. Nicole enjoys switching in and out in the middle of battle, including during a Stun window, to fully capitalize on her DEF shred effect for your DPS Agents, which forces you to alter your rotation and warrants the tag.\n- [Soukaku] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to her M4.\n- [Seth] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to his Additional Ability effect.\n- [Ben] Debuff tag added. Pertaining to his M1."

		"desc": "*1.6 Prydwen Tier List (12/03/2025)*\n\nWith the release of S0 Anby, and an accumulation of data over a number of phases since our last update, we’re making some substantial changes to the tier list - specifically the Damage category. In recent phases of Shiyu Defense a divide between damaging characters currently in the Apex tier has emerged. To address this we’re introducing Tier 4, re-organizing the tiers, and adjusting the ratings of some characters.\n\nAfter the release of Miyabi, Evelyn and now S0 Anby it’s clear the bar for damage dealers has been set higher. To reflect this reality, we’ve had adjust the rating of some older damage dealers down the tier list. With that said these characters are by no means bad, or unable to clear endgame content, they simply don’t destroy it quite at the same pace as the most recent additions to the damage dealing roster. To ensure the tier list still makes sense and each character is in a tier with peers that reflect a similar power level we’ve introduced an additional Tier (Tier 4) and shuffled the majority of characters down the tier list. In addition to this change we’ve also adjusted the meta line indicating what is a niche character and what is a meta character from sitting between Tier 1.5 and Tier 2 to sit between Tier 2 and Tier 3 instead.\n\nThe goal of all these changes isn’t to “drop every character on the tier list” it’s to ensure that each character is grouped with other characters of a similar power level something the previous iteration of the tier list wasn’t quite achieving.\nOutside of this here are a few characters movements we feel deserve their own explanation:\n\n- *[Zhu Yuan] & [Jane doe].* Both remain powerful Agents but are struggling to keep up with other characters residing in the Apex Tier in terms of clear times in the latest phases of Shiyu Defense. If and when the encounters favor them more and they’re able to make a comeback we’ll return them to the highest tiers.\n- *[Piper].* She is one of the few units we’re not shuffling down as a result of this change as she’s put out some incredibly convincing results in more recent Shiyu phases. We’re keeping her in Tier 1 for now but will keep an eye on her to see if she can maintain her performance.\n- *[Qingyi].* We’re placing Qingyi on the watchlist for now. She hasn’t been performing at the level we expect of a Tier 0 stunner and isn’t as meta relevant when it comes to forming teams with Apex Damage dealers as some of her peers. With that said she can be played alongside S0 Anby, so we’re keeping an eye on her for now and seeing how she performs in the coming phase."

		"desc": "*1.5-2 Prydwen Tier List (12/02/2025)*\n\n- *[Evelyn]* has been added to the tier list.\n- We’re placing Evelyn in T0.5 initially with the Expert Tag. This Tag indicates that in the hands of a beginner or “average” player she sits around the T0.5 level, but in the hands of an expert she performs at a T0 level, equivalent to Miyabi. We feel this placement is a reasonable starting point for her considering her difficulty - some consider her incredibly simple and easy to play while others find her more challenging. We’ll be monitoring how the community receives Evelyn - if she’s easier to grasp and play at the highest level than expected we’ll remove the Expert tag from her and raise her to T0, but if she turns out to be just as hard as some fear, we’ll keep her where she is for now.\n- With the arrival of Evelyn and the upcoming release of Anby: Silver Soldier we expect shifts to occur over the next few Shiyu Defense phases in the DPS Category of the Tier List. We are aware that some Apex DPS characters aren’t performing quite as well as they were in the past or to the level some of their peers are currently at. With that said we’ll be holding off on any major changes until the release of Anby: Silver Soldier to see where the meta settles. We already watchlisted Jane Doe because of that, because of all T0.5 characters she had the roughest performance drop recently."

		"desc": "*1.5 Prydwen Tier List (22/01/2025)*\n\n- *[Astra Yao]* has been added to the tier list.\n- Based on the previous feedback of the major rework to our Shiyu Defense Tier list, alongside the latest data performance we’re making a few adjustments to some character’s rankings in addition to the placement of Astra Yao on the tier list.\n- *[Piper] Up.* Piper has continued to demonstrate success in Shiyu as an accessible Anomaly option with strong team options. She was ranked too low as a result of the merge, we’re fixing that with this update.\n- *[Soldier 11] Down.* Based on feedback received, new/Additional clear data and further testing, the general consensus is that Soldier 11 isn’t currently performing at Ellen’s level. As a result we’re lowering Soldier 11’s tier by one rank for now.\n- *[Harumasa].* Harumasa is a character with great potential when played optimally, something that isn’t for everyone. We’ve ranked Harumasa under the assumption that he would be played according to his strongest combos, but this isn’t always realistic due to combat scenarios or player skill/playstyle. In recognition of this, we’re introducing the new Expert Tag to the tier list to both recognize his potential but also highlight his higher skill requirements. For those who can play him to his full potential his effective position on the tier list is unchanged as per the Expert tags description, for those who can’t his new placement applies.\n- *Expert Tag:* Characters tagged with the Expert Tag can be considered one placement higher than their tier list ranking, but you need to master their advanced/harder playstyle for them to qualify for that higher rating."

		"desc": "*1.4 Prydwen Tier List (18/12/2024)*\n\n- *[Miyabi]* has been added to the tier list,\n- *[Harumasa]* has been added to the tier list,\n- *We have combined the Pure DPS and Anomaly DPS columns into one column - DPS.* We’ve intended on doing this for a while now but the release of Miyabi solidified the decision. The Anomaly Category was created under the premise that Anomaly characters would play vastly different to Attack characters much like Grace is different than a character like Soldier 11. This is not how things played out post release. A lot of Anomaly characters function as direct damage dealers akin to Attack characters with the main distinction being one stacks Anomaly related stats and the other stacks CRIT but now with Miyabi even that line is blurred. In ZZZ under the current meta we feel Attack and Anomaly characters can directly be compared in terms of performance, their roles are not different enough to keep them separate and so we have combined them. As a result of this change some characters ranking have been updated to make sense. As always we’ll be reading your feedback,\n- We have added the *meta-lines* that are already present in our other tier lists. They split the tier list into 3 groups, showcasing roughly how they are currently used in the meta: Apex (best of the best), Meta (great characters) and Niche (characters with issues that require more work to achieve good results). There's no Forgotten Ones group yet as the meta isn't in as bad state as HSR and everyone is viable - more or less,\n- We have added a new tag - *Quick Swap.* The tag highlights characters that benefit greatly from swapping to another character during one or many of their abilities that have incredibly long animations. This allows this downside to be mitigated.\n- We have changed the color of the Anomaly related tags like Shock, Burn and Disorder to make them stand out a bit more."
